## Description: 
Payment Assistant is a smart financial assistant that helps users automate and manage their recurring payments safely and easily. With voice commands, users can set up and confirm payments, ensuring they never miss a bill. The system connects with major banking APIs and offers flexible subscription plans based on transaction volume.

Key Features:
- Secure Transactions: Uses strong encryption and follows PCI DSS security standards.
- Bank Integration: Connects directly to banking APIs for seamless payments.
- Voice Command Payments: Users can manage payments hands-free with AI-powered voice recognition.
- Smart Payment Reminders: Sends real-time alerts and notifications to keep users on track.
- Scalable Infrastructure: Built to handle growth and ensure reliable performance.

## Stack: write down the final stack to be use decided for the group
- Frontend: React Native (Expo) for mobile development, ReactJS for web
- Backend: Node.js (NestJS) with GraphQL API

## Frontend design specifications


### Authentication platform", Conduct research to determine which service platform you will use for authentication, ensuring that it offers at least:

#### Chosen platform: AWS Cognito
AWS Cognito meets all authentication requirements:

- Login and password authentication
- SDK for screen generation and API access
- Fully compatible with React Native and ReactJS
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) available
- Sandbox for testing authentication flows

Implementation Steps:

- Configure Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool in AWS.
- Implement authentication flow in React Native using Amplify SDK.
- Customize UI components for login/signup screens.
- Use Postman to test MFA API calls and store results in the repository.


#### Client Architecture

The application follows an N-layer architecture, where:

- The frontend (React Native/ReactJS) communicates with the backend via GraphQL API.
- The backend (NestJS + Node.js) serves as the business logic layer, interacting with the database and external banking APIs.
- The database (PostgreSQL + DynamoDB) stores user payment configurations and transaction logs.
- The authentication layer (Cognito) manages user sessions and authorization.
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS Fargate, API Gateway, Lambda) ensures scalability and resilience.
- The mobile application is built with React Native (hybrid approach), and the web version is implemented with ReactJS using client-side rendering (CSR).

#### Visual Components

##### Patterns & Principles

- SOLID principles (Maintainability and scalability)
- DRY principle (Avoid code repetition)
- Separation of Concerns (SoC) (Frontend, Backend, Database layers)
- Responsive Design (Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS)
- Atomic Design for reusable UI components
- State management with Redux for efficient data handling
- Toolkits and Standards
- AWS Amplify UI components for authentication screens
- Tailwind CSS for UI styling
- Storybook for UI component testing
- Material Design Guidelines for UI/UX consistency

##### Object Design Patterns

The application follows object-oriented design patterns such as:

- Factory Pattern for creating API service instances.
- Singleton Pattern for managing authentication state.
- Observer Pattern for event-driven UI updates (notifications and reminders).
- Adapter Pattern for standardizing API responses from different banks.


### External Services

The system integrates with various external services to enhance its functionality:

- Authentication & Authorization: AWS Cognito (OAuth, MFA, SSO)
- Payments & Banking APIs: Stripe (subscription plans), SINPE/BAC APIs (automated transactions)
- Cloud Storage: AWS S3 (for storing logs and voice command data)
- AI/NLP Processing: Amazon Transcribe & Lex (voice recognition for payments)
- Notifications & Messaging: Twilio (SMS notifications), AWS SNS (push notifications)
- Security & Compliance: AWS Security Hub, AWS WAF, AWS Payment Cryptography for PCI DSS compliance

<!-- 
a) login y password

b) login y password automatic screen generation or SDK for screen generation

c) compatible with your FE programming language

d) access by API available

e) MFA and a sandbox for testing purpose

Using a demo code, proceed to test how the chosen platform works and how the login screen can be customized. Document this process in the MD file. The demo code must be use in the selected programming language of the FE.

Using Postman, make API calls to simulate authentication with MFA. Document the process and save your own Postman collection for future review
